    "### Step 3 - Making the next Generation\n",
    "We have already defined the mating procedure, i.e. taking 2 people and making a child. But we haven't yet defined how we choose the parents. Here I use a pretty simply definition, but more complex ones exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Truncation Selection**: Although basic, this is what I use here as it is good enough. In this method we simply take the top 50% of the population as the potential parents for the next population. From this top 50%, we then randomly choose 2 parents to make a child (+ mutation) until we have enough for our 2nd generation. Note that you can use less, like top 20-30%, but this will result in more exploitation and less exloration. So it might be good to start of with a high number early, but smaller and smaller as you go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fitness proportionate selection, aka roulette wheel selection**: Here all people in the population has a chance to be parents for the next generation. But their chance is related to their fitness, so a person with a high fitness has a high chance of being a parent, but a person with low fitness has a lower chance. The benefits of doing this over truncation selection is that it will automatically perform exploration/exploitation so you don't have to do so. But it can be tricky to get working.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The easiest definition for the probabiltiy is as follows: If $f_i$ is the score for the $i^\\textrm{th}$ person in the population, and we want to **maximize** this score, we define the probability for this individual to be\n",
    "    $$\\large p_i = \\frac{f_i}{\\sum_i f_i}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Importantly, this definition only works in you want to **maximize** the score. If you want to **minimize** the score you will need to use a different definition, which I won't do because it's a bit more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3.1 - Elitism\n",
    "There is one problem if we purely use this mating procedure to make the next generation: there is no gaurantee that the most fit DNA will continue into the next population, nor is there any gaurantee that the most fit DNA will be used as a parent to make the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this we can introduce something knowns as elitism. Importantly, elitism is not always used, but typically is used. In elitism we simply take the top 1-3 fittess DNA of the current generation and simply put it into the next generation. This way we ensure that the next generation will have the best DNA."
